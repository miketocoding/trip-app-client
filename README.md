# Memory Lane

Past travels application. I've always loved traveling and reminiscing on them afterwards. Sometimes we forget about aspects of our trips away and that's why I created Memory Lane. With my app, users will be able to keep trip data in one place such as location, start and end dates, trip rating, other travelers, and standouts from the adventure.

## Planning, Process, and Problem-Solving Strategy
I came into this process as methodical as I could. For the planning portion, I layed out an app idea that at its base would be a travel blog with the potential to grow into a much more well rounded product. The initial stage would be to complete the minimum viable product(MVP) of CRUD then move on to additional functionality when all requirements were met.

My process started with completing the backend API using Python, PostgreSQL, and Django. Throughout this, I used Postman to test my CRUD on trip resource instead of the standard curl-scripts. Once everything worked, I moved onto my React front-end client. Using Hooks, I then coded the front-end CRUD, added some functionality with search, and styled my app mainly using Bootstrap.

My problem-solving strategy revolved around reading the docs, google the issues to see if they were solved by others, leaning on my cohort, and if none of the other options solved my problem, submit an issue ticket to see if an instructor would be able to assist. In most instances this solved any barriers to progression.
